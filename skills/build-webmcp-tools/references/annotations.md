# WebMCP Tool Annotations

Every tool should explicitly set its annotations. Agents assume a tool mutates state unless `readOnlyHint: true` is set.

---

## 1. Annotations Matrix

| Annotation                 | Set `true` When                                                                                                                              | Agent / Browser Behavior                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`readOnlyHint`**         | Tool only reads data (e.g. search, check status) and changes neither application state nor the UI (no navigation, tab switch, or modal).    | Agents assume tools mutate state unless `readOnlyHint: true` is present. Read-only tools can run autonomously in the background.                      |
| **`consequentialHint`**    | Executing the tool performs a significant, real-world, or non-reversible action, e.g. booking a flight, transferring money, deleting an account. | Signals the client or agent to require explicit user confirmation before execution.                                                                   |
| **`untrustedContentHint`** | Output includes any text created or edited by users or third parties, including content from your own database (see §3).                    | Signals the host agent to isolate, spotlight, or delimiter-sandbox (`<untrusted_content>`) the payload to defend against indirect prompt injection. |

The two behavioral hints form a 2×2 matrix:

| `readOnlyHint` | `consequentialHint` | Meaning                                                                    | Examples                                                        |
| :------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`         | `false`             | Safe query; no state or UI change.                                         | `search_flights`, `get_invoice_summary`, `get_app_config`       |
| `false`        | `false`             | Changes application or UI state, but nothing significant or irreversible. | `set_filters`, `switch_tab`, `navigate_to_invoices`, `open_modal`, `initiate_booking`, `update_draft` |
| `false`        | `true`              | Significant, irreversible, or financial real-world action.                 | `book_flight`, `transfer_money`, `delete_account`, `send_email` |
| `true`         | `true`              | Contradictory; do not use.                                                 | —                                                               |

## 2. `readOnlyHint` and `consequentialHint`

- **`readOnlyHint: true` (Query Tools Only)**: Set on queries that read data without modifying application state or the UI (e.g. `get_invoice_summary`, `get_active_tab`).
- **`consequentialHint: true` (Significant Actions Only)**: The WebMCP spec reserves it for actions that are significant, real-world, or non-reversible (payments, bookings, deletions, sending messages), so the browser or agent can require user confirmation.
- **Don't over-flag**: Marking routine UI changes as consequential makes the agent ask for confirmation on every step. Users learn to approve without reading, and the prompt stops protecting the actions that matter.

### UI View Navigation, Tab Switching & Modals

- Tools that shift the active view, route, tab, or modal (`switch_tab`, `navigate_to`, `open_modal`) change client state, so they **must not declare `readOnlyHint: true`**; declare `readOnlyHint: false`.
- They should **not** declare `consequentialHint: true` unless the step itself commits a significant, irreversible action.
- ❌ _Anti-pattern_: `switch_tab` with `readOnlyHint: true` (the agent treats it as a background query).
- ❌ _Anti-pattern_: `navigate_to_invoices` with `consequentialHint: true` (a confirmation prompt for a view change).
- ✅ _Best Practice_: `get_invoices` sets `readOnlyHint: true`; `navigate_to_invoices` sets `readOnlyHint: false`; `pay_invoice` sets `consequentialHint: true`.

### Protecting Unsaved Work

Navigation can unmount a view that holds uncommitted state, such as a half-filled form. Protect it in the tool, not with `consequentialHint`: before navigating, check for unsaved changes and either preserve the draft or return an actionable error so the agent asks the user.

```javascript
async execute({ tab }) {
  if (invoiceForm.hasUnsavedChanges()) {
    return {
      error: "The invoice form has unsaved changes.",
      code: "UNSAVED_CHANGES",
      suggestion: "Ask the user whether to save or discard the draft, then call switch_tab again.",
    };
  }
  await router.navigate(`/${tab}`);
  return `Switched to the ${tab} tab.`;
}
```

### Human-in-the-Loop Hand-off Tools

An `initiate_*` tool that opens a confirmation screen (e.g. `initiate_booking` navigating to checkout, where the user presses Confirm) is navigation: `readOnlyHint: false`, no `consequentialHint`. The hand-off itself is the confirmation boundary. If you also expose a tool that commits the action directly (e.g. `confirm_booking` charging the card), that tool declares `consequentialHint: true`.

## 3. Mandatory `untrustedContentHint: true` for UGC & Third-Party Content

- Any tool querying, searching, or returning content created or edited by users or third parties (workspace notes, task descriptions, comments, reviews, profile bios, uploaded files, external web content) **must** declare `untrustedContentHint: true`, even when stored in your own application database (the "First-Party Database" Fallacy; see [agent-security.md](./agent-security.md)).
- **Why**: User-authored text is the primary vector for indirect prompt injection. Declaring `untrustedContentHint: true` instructs the consuming browser agent to isolate, spotlight, or delimiter-sandbox (`<untrusted_content>`) the payload defensively rather than executing embedded adversarial instructions.
- **UGC vs Application Configuration**:
  - ❌ _Requires `untrustedContentHint: true`_: `get_note`, `search_tasks`, `list_comments`, `read_document`, `get_customer_reviews` (contains user-generated text).
  - ✅ _Omit `untrustedContentHint`_: `get_user_preferences`, `get_app_config`, `get_project_config`, `list_system_locales` (trusted system settings and flags without user-authored text).
- `untrustedContentHint` is independent of `readOnlyHint`: a UGC query tool usually declares both.

## 4. Declarative Forms

Declarative `<form>` tools express the human-in-the-loop boundary through `toolautosubmit` instead: omit it for sensitive, financial, or destructive actions so the user confirms the submission (see [declarative-patterns.md](./declarative-patterns.md)).
